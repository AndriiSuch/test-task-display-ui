- NAVIGATION
  For navigation here I use @react-navigation library because this library more comfortable and usable than react-navigation

- PERFORMANCE
  For better perfomance I use rtk-query to cache data from requests. I also use FlatList to display list of item

- HOW TO RUN APPLICATION

Use node >=18
yarn or npm install - for install all dependencies
cd ios && pod install - for install pods ( For IOS )
cd .. && yarn start or npm start - start metro
open new terminal
cd ios && yarn ios or npm ios
